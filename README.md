## üì¶ Apache Cassandra Installation
TheHive uses Apache Cassandra for database storage. Supported version: 4.0.x.

Install Apache Cassandra (example for Debian/Ubuntu):
Installation#

DEB
1. Add Apache Cassandra repository references:
    Download Apache Cassandra repository keys using the following command:
```
wget -qO -  https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg
```

   Add the repository to your system by appending the following line to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list file. This file may not exist, and you may need to create it.

   ```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg] https://debian.cassandra.apache.org 40x main" |  sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
```
2. Once the repository references are added, update your package index and install Cassandra using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install cassandra
   ```
   
   By default, data is stored in /var/lib/cassandra. Set appropriate permissions for this directory to avoid any issues with data storage and access.

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration
Configure Cassandra by modifying settings within the /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml file.

1.Locate the Cassandra configuration file:

 Navigate to the directory containing the Cassandra configuration file `/etc/cassandra/`.

2.Edit the cassandra.yaml file:

 Open the cassandra.yaml file in a text editor with appropriate permissions.

3.Configure cluster name:

 Set the cluster_name parameter to the desired name. This name helps identify the Cassandra cluster.

4.Configure listen address:

 Set the listen_address parameter to the IP address of the node within the cluster. Other nodes within the cluster use this address to communicate.

5.Configure RPC address:

 Set the rpc_address parameter to the IP address of the node to enable clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster.

6.Configure seed provider:

 Ensure the seed_provider section is properly configured. The seeds parameter should contain the IP addresses of the seed nodes in the cluster.

7.Configure directories:

 Set the directories for data storage, commit logs, saved caches, and hints per your requirements. Ensure that the specified directories exist and have appropriate permissions.

8.Save the changes:

 After making the necessary configurations, save the changes to the cassandra.yaml file.

## üî•Start the service

1. Execute the following command to start the Cassandra service:
~~~
sudo systemctl start cassandra
~~~

2. Enable the Cassandra service to restart automatically after a system reboot:
~~~
sudo systemctl enable cassandra
~~~

3. Optional: If the Cassandra service was started automatically before configuring it, it's recommended to stop it, remove existing data, and restart it once the configuration is updated.
Execute the following commands:
